 Project 1: Write a script that inputs a line of plaintext and a distance value and outputs an encrypted text using a cesar cipher. The script should work for any printable characters. 

 Project 5: A bit shift is a procedure whereby the bits in a string are moved to the left or to the right. For example, we can shift the bits in the string 1011 two places to the left to produce the string 1110. Note that the left most bits are wrapped around the right side of the string in this opertion. Define two scripts, shifLeft.py and shiftRight.py, that expect a bit stirng as an input. The script shiftLeft.py shifts the bits in its input one place to the left, wrapping the leftmost bit to the rightmost position. The script shiftRight performs the inverse operation. Each script prints the resulting string. 

 Project 8: Write a script name copyfile.py. This script should prompt the user for the names of two text files. The contents of the first file should be input and written to the second file.
